Learning github, I figured a good way to learn would be to create a repo for the simulations I've been working on. Feel free to look around, but not everything is completely up to date, so I can't guarantee all of it will work. This is just testing out github. I'll eventually clean everything up and write proper documentation so that other people can learn how to use this code.
