# luca-ion-sims
Learning github, I figured a good way to learn would be to create a repo for the simulations I've been working on. Feel free to look around and try running things, but not everything is completely up to date, so I can't guarantee it will work. I'll eventually clean everything up and write proper documentation so that other people can learn how to use this code.
