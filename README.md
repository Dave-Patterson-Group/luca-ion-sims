# luca-ion-sims
Learning github, I figured a good way to learn would be to create a repo for the simulations I've been working on. Feel free to look around, but not everything is completely up to date, so I can't guarantee all of it will work. This is just testing out github. I'll eventually clean everything up and write proper documentation so that other people can learn how to use this code.

I added an example script, EXAMPLEshowcrystallize.m, for anyone who wants to try out the simulations for themselves. All you need to do is clone the repository to your local machine, open up EXAMPLEshowcrystallize.m in matlab, and just run the script. It will generate two gifs in the same directory, showing the initial motion and final motion of 1 strontium and 1 dark ion before and after a sympathetic cooling sequence. The script will likely take a while to run, maybe about an hour? It will print its progress in the command window. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or run into any problems.
